## About the app

This app is a cooperative editor that use redis and websockets to communicate between application clients.
Share and create code with your teammembers.

I've used <a target="_blank" href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> as websocket supporting technology because Vercel is not supporitng long lasting conenctions.

<a target="_blank" href="https://redis.com/">Redis</a> technology is used for data replication between clients that arraives to the rooms or reconnecting to the room. 

The application allow you to write code and every other person connected to the room can see the code and modified it in the real time. 

There is a slight delay between clients so the app do not spam the pusher API with request.

The application has also integrated chat so you can share the messages, links etc with your colegues along the codding.

The Javascript code can be compiled on the server with help of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2">VM2 library</a>

The syntaxt higlight is provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco Editor</a>

The application is written fully in React and styled with CSS with Next.js library.
